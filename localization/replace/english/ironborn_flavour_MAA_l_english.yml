  harlaw_reapers_flavor:0 "The sigil of House Harlaw is a silver scythe. The House Harlaw Reapers have taken that sigil and turned it into an actual weapon of war. Agricultural scythes make poor combat weapons, but the Reapers have adopted using long-handled axes with equally massive blades. These grisly instruments can mow down men in combat the way a regular scythe can mow down wheat in the field."

  iron_fleet_crew_flavor:0 "Recruited from the fiercest raiders of the Ironborn, the sailors of the Iron Fleet are equally deadly in boarding actions and land battles. They are disciplined, well-armed, and loyal to none but the lord of the Seastone Chair."
