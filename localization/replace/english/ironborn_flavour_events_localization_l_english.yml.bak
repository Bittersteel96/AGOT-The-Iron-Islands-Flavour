  ironborn_flavour_events.002.desc: "This evening, my retinue and I gathered for yet another sermon by the wandering Drowned Priest, who had recently arrived in my domain. He spoke of the ancient kings of salt and stone, of the times of our former glory, when the Ironborn ruled both sea and land.\n"We have strayed from the Old Way and thus lost the power granted to us by the Drowned God," the priest declared, "And when the school of fish runs aground, the fault lies with those who leads it." \nThe priest’s accusing finger pointed at me. My companions exchanged confused glances, impatiently awaiting my response..."

  ironborn_flavour_events.006.c.tt: "The lash will do the speaking this day. Pain will be his punishment, a reminder of the thrall's place beneath the Ironborn. Yet mercy, even this small, may be seen as weakness by my people."

However, those among the captains and lords who often sail to the Green Lands sometimes return with bards, maesters, or knights.\nOne such hedge knight, who had recently joined the crew of one of my captains, was drinking too much at a communal feast. Having indulged far beyond reason, he suddenly began mocking the "iron-arsed folk." \nFirst, the drunkard rambled about how piracy and raiding had failed to lift the Ironborn out of poverty. Then, he mentioned that the Red Priests of the eastern god of fire consider the Drowned God to be nothing more than a malevolent demon. But even that wasn't enough for him, as if he didn’t notice the angry stares from all around.\n"This Island is so miserable!" he laughed. "Shacks and bumpkins everywhere! All you're good for is raiding defenseless coastal villages, and when knights show up, you run with your tails between your legs!"\nMy men exchanged furious looks. One reached for his dagger, then another. The knight, suddenly sobering up and realizing the peril he was in, turned to me with a pleading gaze.\n"My Lord, forgive my words, I beg you… I've had too much wine!
